                You were there when I was at my lowest and you brought me out of it, brought a smile on my face but no this isnt gonna be senti! Yes im very much grateful to have you in my life but can you for once, BE ON TIME? My birthday? An hour and a half late when i was about to go sleep. Kolkata? Airport you were late and i had to hear crap from you know who! Haha you thought I‚Äôd be sweet its your birthday eh nope. Hehe. You‚Äôre my HYPE MAN, my RAMDAYAL. The crazy chap encouraging me to sing pari hu may at 9 in the night in the middle of the road acting all drunk over 10 scoops of icecream gosh that was crazy! And my one and only fiance omg wedding in paris! Life would basically be boring without you annoying me. I mean its still boring when you start off with that science crap i always act as if I understand but i dont really do. But you even make that fun. Only tejumanju knows how you do it since they‚Äôre the love of your lifeü§°
                Ah too much to read but you know how i get. Here‚Äôs to you sleeping in the conference hall or my birthday, to many more trips, watching you achieve all those wonders and ah yes, gossipingü•∞I love you Ramdayal‚ô•Ô∏è
                Ps. WHEN ARE WE MEETING FOR HEAVEN‚ÄôS SAKE ITS ALMOST TWO YEARS :/</p>

                I might still be older than you but dw i'm still shorter than you. Besides you have always been the more mature one of us, luckily that has helped me out of a lot of problems that I have faced this year. In fact I don't think I would still be here if it wasn't for you and you should know that because it really means a lot to me. Everything about you does (even your cheesy bad pick up lines that probably won't work on anyone, but still makes me laugh) Hopefully we will continue to find new things to laugh about and help eachother with and even though I might say this a lot I love you.

              <p>Happy birthday Ayushman!! Thanks for always being there for me and helping me with my problems even though you have a mountain of problems of your own. Excuse my grammar cause uk how trash it has become. I really can't appreciate enough how much you have helped me, whether it's academics,random knowledge or clearing my silly doubts,you have always been there for me. The talk you gave me the other day about how not to compare and to give papers, was the most helpful thing someone has ever told me in a while. I hope that even years later we're still really good friends and you still give me epic knowledge about new shit which I can't even comprehend. Once again thank you for being there for me(uk how bad I am at such paragraphs) and remember whenever you need help I'm always there for you. Aight enough of my cringey paragraph hope you enjoy your birthday and try not to study(I know you'll still study but I can hope). Peace out</p>

              <p>hi ayushmannnü•¶ happy 17th birthday broxanneee. oh god i don‚Äôt know where to beginüòÇüò≠ ayushman you are not just my bestfriend, it really doesn‚Äôt do justice to what you mean to me. you are my Brother(family) and always will be. you have never ever failed to make me feel better about ANY problem i have. you , sir, had the fucking patience to listen to me rant about everything in my life. i repeat, everything in my life. i have never ever known anyone who is as down-to-earth and as talented as youuu. i mean you have so much of knowledge and maturity. your attitude towards everyone, and the way you always help others because YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO is just what makes you sooooo pure-hearted. i always feel like giving you a big slap when you underestimate yourself:) its so funny(and extremely annoying)how you just don‚Äôt know how pure and good you are. ITS ACTUALLY YOU who maintains their calm and handles shit. ayushman i know and i hope that you continue to be like this. never ever fuckin change , except TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF. you have literally acted on the statement, ‚Äúbeing through thick and thin‚Äù , you have never ever judged me, and always made me feel better about myself, always encouraged , motivated me and made me believe in MYSELF. you are the truest and BEST BROTHER IN THIS WHOLE FUCKIN UNIVERSE. and i hate that i am not able to solve your problems properly, i am so sorry for that. </p>
